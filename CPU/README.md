# Codes on CPU Platform

This folder conatains the C++ codes evaluating AnoSketch and AnoTable on CPU platform. We evaulate the performance of AnoSketch on finding AFG with drastic packet drops and inflated latency, and evluate the performance of AnoTable on estimating per-flow packet interval distribution. 

## File Descriptions

- `AnoSketch_Experiments` contains the codes to evaluate the performance of AnoSketch.
- `AnoTable_Experiments` contains the codes to evaluate the performance of AnoTable.

More details can be found in the folders.
