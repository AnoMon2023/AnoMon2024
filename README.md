# AnoMon: Network-wide Measurement on Anomalies

This repository contains all related code of our paper "AnoMon: Network-wide Measurement on Anomalies". 

## Introduction

Network measurement is crucial for successful network maintenance. The contradiction between limited measurement resources and unlimited network traffic has always been a great challenge for network measurement. An ideal measurement system should achieve reduced monitoring overhead that does not grow with the traffic scale. Towards this goal, this paper presents AnoMon, an efficient and accurate network measurement system based on two sketches. Our design philosophy is to first identify the flow groups that contains abnormal traffic, which are named abnormal flow groups (AFG), with coarse-grained passive measurement at network edge, and then monitor the traffic in AFG with fine-grained active measurement inside the network. At network edge, we propose a sketch named AnoSketch to identify AFG. Inside the network, we propose a sketch named AnoTable to collect per-flow per-hop information. We fully implement an AnoMon prototype in a testbed built with programmable switches and conduct extensive experiments. Experimental results show that compared to LightGuardian and Marple, AnoMon achieves 2.5x higher accuracy in locating anomalies with consistently low overhead (<1.5Mbps). All codes are released anonymously.
